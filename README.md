📦 Included Components
1. Data Processing
Missing-value imputation (missing_value.py)
Correlation-based adjacency matrix generation (adjacency_matrix.py)
Final processed data and generated graphs are stored in data/.
2. Model Configurations
This repository includes four model configurations used throughout the experimental workflow:
TimesNet — Extracts dominant periodicity and temporal features.
STGNN (TimesNet + HGL) — Incorporates temporal modeling with hybrid graph learning.
SG-STGNN — Enhances temporal signals with SG smoothing.
RimeSG-STGNN — The complete framework integrating SG filtering, RIME optimization, multi-scale temporal modeling, and hybrid graph learning.
Each folder contains:
Model definition
Training script
Configuration files (if applicable)
3. Optimization Module
RIME Hyperparameter Optimization (rime_hpo.py)
Used for automatic tuning of SG parameters and key model hyperparameters.

📊 Data Description
The data/ directory includes:
Original high-frequency DO monitoring data
Missing-value–filled datasets
Pearson-correlation adjacency matrices for graph learning
All datasets follow the preprocessing pipeline used in the experimental study.
